The LIKE clause was used for searching/browsing on the following parameters:
title, director, star name, first character.

For the title, director, and star name, the clause used for LIKE was 
LIKE '%search_query%' where search_query is the field given by the user 
for the specific parameter. This clause makes it so the user will be
given results where the search query is found anywhere within the parameter.

For the first character parameter, the clause used was LIKE 'character%' where
character is the character the user selected to search the movie title for. This 
clause makes it so the user is given results where the title has to start with 
the given character and maps it to anything, as long as the title starts with that
character.
